macOS requires chmod for .command file.   
Please open terminal and run   
``` shell
$chmod u+x search_download.command
```
and then right click on search_download.command to open it.  
after first running, it works with double click.  

I haven't tried full-test for this because my macOS enviornment is enough constructed.  
So please notify when you have troubles, I want to know what will happens when this is ran on clean macOS.
